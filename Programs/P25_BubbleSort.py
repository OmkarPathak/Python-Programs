#This program shows an example of bubble sort using Python

#   Bubblesort is an elementary sorting algorithm. The idea is to
#   imagine bubbling the smallest elements of a (vertical) array to the
#   top; then bubble the next smallest; then so on until the entire
#   array is sorted. Bubble sort is worse than both insertion sort and
#   selection sort. It moves elements as many times as insertion sort
#   (bad) and it takes as long as selection sort (bad). On the positive
#   side, bubble sort is easy to understand. Also there are highly
#   improved variants of bubble sort.

#   Best O(n^2); Average O(n^2); Worst O(n^2)

def bubbleSort(List):
    for i in range(len(List)):
        for j in range(len(List) - 1, i, -1):
            if List[j] < List[j - 1]:
                List[j], List[j - 1] = List[j - 1], List[j]
    return List

if __name__ == '__main__':
    List = [3, 4, 2, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9]
    print('Sorted List:',bubbleSort(List))
